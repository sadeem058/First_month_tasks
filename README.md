## Base Printing Specification

This base model was printed while preserving the original **length and width** with no changes applied to its outer dimensions.  
The only modification performed was a **bottom carving (hollowing)** using the **Shell** tool to reduce material usage.

### Design Details
- Original length and width maintained
- Bottom hollowing applied with a **0.7 ratio**
- Hollowing created using the **Shell** tool
- Carving applied from the underside only
- External geometry and top surface remain unchanged

### Printing Setup
- Printer: AnkerMake M5C
- Nozzle: 0.4 mm
- Filament: ABS Because it can withstand heat and weight
- Layer Height: 0.1 mm
- Wall loops: 4 mm
- Sparse infill desity: 50%
- Generate Support: Yes-12.75g

I tried to make the dimensions of the robot as required, but I didn't change the **width** of the base, so I couldn't meet the **120mm** width requirement.

I think if the wheels get any thinner, the car won't be able to handle it.
